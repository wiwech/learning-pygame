Following along Sean M Tracey's "Make Games with Pygame", and taking my own direction when confident.
I only include code that I am writing myself, though of course there are elements (some variable names, repeated functions, libraries) that are copied from or share similarities with Tracey's work. Find the originals over here: https://github.com/seanmtracey/Games-with-Pygame
